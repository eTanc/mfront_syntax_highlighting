# MFront Syntax Highlighting

This project provides simple syntax highlighting for the [MFront](http://tfel.sourceforge.net/) language for minimum ease of use with the Sublime Text editor.

## Installation

On the Sublime Text menu open `Preferences > Browse Packages`. Next, open the `User` folder and place the provided `mfront.sublime-syntax` file there. The syntax highlighting should occur automatically, although you might need to reopen your MFront files to see the effects.

## Troubleshooting

If the highlighting doesn't work, make sure you placed the `mfront.sublime-syntax` in the correct folder (may vary between systems and installations). If the installation was successfull, make sure the language selected for the file syntax highlighting is mfront in the lower right corner of the window. If any other issues arise, don't hesitate to create an issue in this repository.

### Disclaimer

This project does not follow any official grammar rules for the language. All syntax highlighting was made by arbitrary choices by me and may (eventually) conform to the official specifications (that will probably have to be reverse engineered from [here](https://github.com/thelfer/tfel-editor)).
